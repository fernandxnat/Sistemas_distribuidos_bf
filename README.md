## Project definition.
As our project of distributed computing er are going to work with Twitter to obtain data from the daily trends.<br/>
We want to study the type of accounts that the users are obtaining the news from, mainly if it is a "verified" account or a normal user account also if the number of followers is a determinant factor for a tweet to go viral. As well we want to study not only the news but the trends in general.
<br/><br/>
Given the most popular trends we are going to identify the top ones and from them we will locate the most popular tweet or tweets based on the impressions, retweets, likes and replies so we can know the type of account the people are caring the most related to the news or the popular trend. We want to know if there is a pattern in the type of news and the type of account the has the most popular tweet. Mostly we want to divide the accounts in two, whether if it is verified, like the journalists accounts or the news channels accounts or real news sites, and the other group would be the normal users. Another thing we would like to do is get the localization of these popular tweets to see where these users are tweeting and if the place is an important factor in it.<br/>
## General objectives
  - Get the daily data from Twitter.
  - Locate the most popular trends of the day.
  - Get the most popular tweet or tweets, based mainly in the amount of impressions and retweets.
  - Identify the type of account.
  - Make this process automatically, and store it in the web.
  
## Software tools
  - Python 3.
  - Twitter API.
  - http server.
  - Text editor.
  - Libraries: tweepy and from this library we also use OAuthHandler and Stream. From tweepy.streaming we used StreamListener the other libraries are twitter, json, datetime, pandas and matplotlib.
  
## General system architecture.
- Data source : Twitter API.
- Storage system: Mysql.
- Main processing: Pyhton, Tweepy, Json.
- Visualization: Matplotlib and HTML5.

## Data source.
Our data source is the Twitter API, from there we are going to obtain the necessary data form the daily trends.
